It performed all steps of cataract removal: making the incision, destroying the lens and vacuuming the fractured pieces. Today the device is used globally.Among her many firsts, Dr Bath was the first woman ophthalmologist to be appointed to the faculty of the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine Jules Stein Eye Institute, the first woman to chair an ophthalmology residency program in the United States, and the first African-American woman doctor to receive a patent for a medical purpose.
